One of Final Fantasy 16's main issues is the accessories being too weak to make a difference, this mod fixes it by buffing every single one to make up for the low slots. This doesn't make them too op as I tried to keep it as balanced as possible.

Fully Compatible with mThund3R's Eikonic Equipment - Gear and Recipe Overhaul which I recommend to pair with this mod to further enhance the experience. Just make sure to place my mod above his in Reloaded-ll.

Ask for permission before releasing mod to other websites.

If you seek to use my mod with your own project, then ask me for permission first.
